# FalshHx
Falsh is a bash-like shell for Windows, macOS and Linux. FalshHx is a rewrite in Haxe, as it is vaguely C#-like but compiles to native executables.

## Features
* Will execute any command line program and show its output. Currently it is not possible to write to stdin, but this will come soon.
* Built-in commands for directory changing (`cd` and `pwd`).
* WIP: command history. Persists between runs and has a configurable buffer size.
* WIP: glob for files/directories.
* WIP: UNIX-style pipes.

## Required Packages
* haxe-files (>=1.1.1)

## Long-Term Goals
* Full bash-style scripting capabilities.
